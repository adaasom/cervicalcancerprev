    <h1>Cervical Cancer Prevention and Screening</h1>
    <h2>Introduction
        <p> As it's name suggests, cervical cancer is the cancer of the cervix. Almost none would die of cervical
            cancer, if everywoman recieved adequate healthcare. Cervical cancer is the 4th most common cancer in women.
            According to WHO, about 604,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 342,000 deaths in 2020. Unfortunately, 90%
            of new cases occur in low and middle income countries.</p>
        <p>About 13,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with cercical cancer each year. About 4,000 die from
            it yearly.</p>

    <h2>What's Cervical Cancer?
        <p>Cervical cancer is a cancer of the cervix, a lower and narrow part of the uterus leading into the uterus. The
            cercix is shaped like a donut when visualised from the vagina. Cervical cancer takes years to develop. The
            changes in the cercix starts off with changes in the cells of the cercix. The cells change and grow rapidly
            before developing to fully blown cancer. This is termed the precancerous stage also called "dysplasia" or
            CIN. Through screening, these changes can be found early and prevented. Early diagnosis and treatment spread
            to other parts of the body. This stage is called cancer metastatis.</p>

    <h2>Causes of Cervical Cancer?
        <p>HPV infection is the major cause of cervical cancer. It is the most common STD and usually goes away by it's own. About 90% of the infection is cleared eventually. The reason why some people develop long-term HPV infektion is not completly known. </p>
